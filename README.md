# hola-mundo
my first repository in GitHub

My name is Luis Aparicio, I'm from Venezuela and my job is to teach computer science (and some economics also) at an undergraduate level at my Alma Mater Universidad Central de Venezuela.

I am looking to improve my skills as a programmer, thatÂ´s why I create this acount on GitHub.
